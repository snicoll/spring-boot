/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type is a source of configuration properties metadata.
 * <p>
 * This annotation has no effect on the actual binding process, but serves as a hint to
 * the {@code spring-boot-configuration-processor} to generate full metadata for the type.
 * <p>
 * Typically, this annotation is only required for types located in a different module
 * than the {@code @ConfigurationProperties} class that references them. When both types
 * are in the same module, the annotation processor can automatically discover full
 * metadata as long as the source is available.
 * <p>
 * Use this annotation when metadata for types located outside the module is needed:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Nested types annotated by {@code @NestedConfigurationProperty}</li>
 * <li>Base classes that a {@code @ConfigurationProperties}-annotated type extends
 * from</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * In the example below, {@code ServerProperties} is located in module "A" and
 * {@code Host} in module "B":<pre><code class="java">
 * &#064;ConfigurationProperties("example.server")
 * class ServerProperties {
 *
 *     &#064;NestedConfigurationProperty
 *     private final Host host = new Host();
 *
 *     public Host getHost() { ... }
 *
 *     // Other properties, getter, setter.
 *
 * }</code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Properties from {@code Host} are detected as they are based on the type, but
 * description and default value are not. To fix this, add the
 * {@code spring-boot-configuration-processor} to module "B" if it is not present already
 * and update {@code Host} as follows::<pre><code class="java">
 * &#064;ConfigurationPropertiesSource
 * class Host {
 *
 *     /**
 *      * URL to use.
 *      *&#47;
 *     private String url = "https://example.com";
 *
 *     // Other properties, getter, setter.
 *
 * }</code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Similarly the metadata of a base class that a
 * {@code @ConfigurationProperties}-annotated type extends from can also be detected.
 * Consider the following example:<pre><code class="java">
 * &#064;ConfigurationProperties("example.client.github")
 * class GitHubClientProperties extends AbstractClientProperties {
 *
 *     // Additional properties, getter, setter.
 *
 * }</code></pre>
 * <p>
 * As with nested types, adding {@code @ConfigurationPropertiesSource} to
 * {@code AbstractClientProperties} and the {@code spring-boot-configuration-processor} to
 * its module ensures full metadata generation.
